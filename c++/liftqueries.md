Whenever someone calls the lift from N th floor, the lift closest to that floor comes to pick him up. If both the lifts are at equidistant from the N th floor, them the lift from the lower floor comes up.

First line contains a integer T denoting the number of test cases. Next T lines contains a single integer N denoting the floor from which lift is called. Output T lines containing one character "A" if the first lift goes to N th floor or "B" for the second lift.
