# C++ Problems
C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes". The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms.

C++ was designed with a bias toward system programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights. C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications, including desktop applications, video games, servers (e.g. e-commerce, Web search, or SQL servers), and performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes).

To set up your own coding environment please have a look at the help page for [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp).

In the following table you will have links to the original problem in the source platform. A short text from the question hosted on GitHub and also my solution to the problem. Please use the links to have a look at the questions or even run the programs to verify the results.

NOTE: The code is not commented as this is purely an exercise for me.

For those who aren't familiar with coding I have written small code examples to help understand the basics. Please contact me if you would like a short primer on coding on any of my social media channels or by email which you can see on my profile.
