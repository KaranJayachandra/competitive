# Competitive Programming

Solutions to competitive programming questions that I have solved across different platforms using various languages. I have always been interested in puzzle solving and when I first came across Competitive Programming I was very excited but that fizzled down from the lack of motivation. But I have picked it up again and solve problems when I don't work on any projects as a form of working my brain. I have initially started using C++ as it has the fastest execution time. I used VS Code to develeop the code. This repo might not have any practical use for the reader but is used as a showcase and archive.
